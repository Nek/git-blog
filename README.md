An utterly foolish idea to use Git as a DB for a twitter-like blog.
It's built on top of Babashka and Clojure, because fun!
## Prerequisites
- Git
- jc <https://github.com/kellyjonbrazil/jc>
## Example
### Blog "DB" with a GH Action
<https://github.com/Nek/log.dudnik.dev>
### Rendered blog (using GH Pages)
<https://github.com/Nek/log>
### Final Result
https://log.dudnik.dev/
